      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## Ventajas de Usar Gemini para Generar Contenido en Markdown\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Generación de Contenido Estructurado y Legible Automáticamente**\n",
      "Gemini puede comprender y aplicar convenciones de formato Markdown para organizar la información de manera lógica y fácil de leer. Esto incluye:\n",
      "*   **Encabezados (`#`, `##`, etc.):** Para estructurar temas y subtemas.\n",
      "*   **Listas (viñetas `*` o números `1.`)**: Para enumerar puntos clave o pasos.\n",
      "*   **Negrita (`**texto**`) y Cursiva (`*texto*`)**: Para enfatizar palabras o frases importantes.\n",
      "*   **Citas en bloque (`> texto`)**: Para destacar fragmentos de texto.\n",
      "Esto ahorra tiempo al no tener que aplicar manualmente el formato, resultando en documentos claros desde el primer borrador.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Facilita la Creación de Documentación Técnica y Código**\n",
      "Markdown es el formato preferido para mucha documentación técnica, READMEs, y blogs de desarrollo. Gemini es excelente para:\n",
      "*   **Bloques de código (` ```lenguaje ` ` ` ` `):** Puede generar ejemplos de código en cualquier lenguaje y envolverlos automáticamente en bloques de código con resaltado de sintaxis, lo que los hace directamente copiables y legibles.\n",
      "*   **Comandos de terminal (` `comando` `):** Puede formatear comandos inline para una fácil identificación.\n",
      "*   **Tablas (`| Encabezado | Encabezado |`):** Aunque a veces requiere un pequeño ajuste, Gemini puede construir la estructura básica de tablas para presentar datos de forma organizada.\n",
      "Esto agiliza la creación de guías, tutoriales y documentación para desarrolladores.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Versatilidad para Exportar y Publicar en Múltiples Plataformas**\n",
      "El contenido generado por Gemini en Markdown es increíblemente versátil porque Markdown es un formato universalmente aceptado. Puede ser:\n",
      "*   **Convertido fácilmente** a HTML, PDF, Word, ePub, etc., usando herramientas como Pandoc.\n",
      "*   **Publicado directamente** en plataformas como GitHub (para READMEs), blogs (WordPress, Medium, Jekyll), foros, wikis, y muchas otras que soportan Markdown nativamente, manteniendo el formato original.\n",
      "*   **Reutilizado** en diferentes contextos sin perder su estructura o legibilidad.\n",
      "Esta flexibilidad asegura que el contenido creado pueda adaptarse a casi cualquier necesidad de publicación o visualización.\n",

      "Anthropic is an AI safety and research company. We build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems.\n",
      "Join us\n",
      "Join us\n",
      "Join us\n",
      "Our Purpose\n",
      "We believe AI will have a vast impact on the world. Anthropic is dedicated to building systems that people can rely on and generating research about the opportunities and risks of AI.\n",
      "We Build Safer Systems\n",
      "We aim to build frontier AI systems that are reliable, interpretable, and steerable. We conduct frontier research, develop and apply a variety of safety techniques, and deploy the resulting systems via a set of partnerships and products.\n",
      "Safety Is a Science\n",
      "We treat AI safety as a systematic science, conducting research, applying it to our products, feeding those insights back into our research, and regularly sharing what we learn with the world along the way.\n",
      "Interdisciplinary\n",
      "Anthropic is a collaborative team of researchers, engineers, policy experts, business leaders and operators, who bring our experience from many different domains to our work.\n",
      "AI Companies are One Piece of a Big Puzzle\n",
      "AI has the potential to fundamentally change how the world works. We view ourselves as just one piece of this evolving puzzle. We collaborate with civil society, government, academia, nonprofits and industry to promote safety industry-wide.\n",
      "The Team\n",
      "We’re a team of researchers, engineers, policy experts and operational leaders, with experience spanning a variety of disciplines, all working together to build reliable and understandable AI systems.\n",
      "Research\n",
      "We conduct frontier AI research across a variety of modalities, and explore novel and emerging safety research areas from interpretability to RL from human feedback to policy and societal impacts analysis.\n",
      "Policy\n",
      "We think about the impacts of our work and strive to communicate what we’re seeing at the frontier to policymakers and civil society in the US and abroad to help promote safe and reliable AI.\n",
      "Product\n",
      "We translate our research into tangible, practical tools like Claude that benefit businesses, nonprofits and civil society groups and their clients and people around the globe.\n",
      "Operations\n",
      "Our people, finance, legal, and recruiting teams are the human engines that make Anthropic go. We’ve had previous careers at NASA, startups, and the armed forces and our diverse experiences help make Anthropic a great place to work (and we love plants!).\n",
      "What we value and how we act\n",
      "Every day, we make critical decisions that inform our ability to achieve our mission. Shaping the future of AI and, in turn, the future of our world is a responsibility and a privilege. Our values guide how we work together, the decisions we make, and ultimately how we show up for each other and work toward our mission.\n",
      "01\n",
      "Act for the global good.\n",
      "We strive to make decisions that maximize positive outcomes for humanity in the long run. This means we’re willing to be very bold in the actions we take to ensure our technology is a robustly positive force for good. We take seriously the task of safely guiding the world through a technological revolution that has the potential to change the course of human history, and are committed to helping make this transition go well.\n",
      "02\n",
      "Hold light and shade.\n",
      "AI has the potential to pose unprecedented risks to humanity if things go badly. It also has the potential to create unprecedented benefits for humanity if things go well. We need shade to understand and protect against the potential for bad outcomes. We need light to realize the good outcomes.\n",

      "Be good to our users.\n",
      "At Anthropic, we define “users” broadly. Users are our customers, policy-makers, Ants, and anyone impacted by the technology we build or the actions we take. We cultivate generosity and kindness in all our interactions—with each other, with our users, and with the world at large. Going above and beyond for each other, our customers, and all of the people affected by our technology is meeting expectations.\n",

      "As a safety-first company, we believe that building reliable, trustworthy, and secure systems is our collective responsibility - and the market agrees.

We want to constantly set the industry bar for AI safety and security and drive others to do the same.\n",

      "What we value and how we act\n",
      "Every day, we make critical decisions that inform our ability to achieve our mission. Shaping the future of AI and, in turn, the future of our world is a responsibility and a privilege. Our values guide how we work together, the decisions we make, and ultimately how we show up for each other and work toward our mission.\n",
      "01\n",
      "Act for the global good.\n",
      "We strive to make decisions that maximize positive outcomes for humanity in the long run. This means we’re willing to be very bold in the actions we take to ensure our technology is a robustly positive force for good. We take seriously the task of safely guiding the world through a technological revolution that has the potential to change the course of human history, and are committed to helping make this transition go well.\n",
      "02\n",
      "Hold light and shade.\n",
      "AI has the potential to pose unprecedented risks to humanity if things go badly. It also has the potential to create unprecedented benefits for humanity if things go well. We need shade to understand and protect against the potential for bad outcomes. We need light to realize the good outcomes.\n",
      "03\n",
      "Be good to our users.\n",
      "At Anthropic, we define “users” broadly. Users are our customers, policy-makers, Ants, and anyone impacted by the technology we build or the actions we take. We cultivate generosity and kindness in all our interactions—with each other, with our users, and with the world at large.

We work to inspire a ‘race to the top’ dynamic where AI developers must compete to develop the most safe and secure AI systems. We want to constantly set the industry bar for AI safety and security and drive others to do the same.\n",
      "05\n",
      "Do the simple thing that works.\n",
      "We take an empirical approach to problems and care about the size of our impact and not the sophistication of our methods. This doesn’t mean we throw together haphazard solutions. It means we try to identify the simplest solution and iterate from there. We don’t invent a spaceship if all we need is a bicycle.\n",
      "06\n",
      "Be helpful, honest, and harmless.\n",
      "Anthropic is a high-trust, low-ego organization. We communicate kindly and directly, assuming good intentions even in disagreement. We are thoughtful about our actions, avoiding harm and repairing relationships when needed. Everyone contributes, regardless of role. If something urgently needs to be done, the right person to do it is probably you!\n",
      "07\n",
      "Put the mission first.\n",

It engenders trust and collaboration and is the final arbiter in our decisions. When it comes to our mission, none of us are bystanders. We each take personal ownership over making our mission successful.\n",
      "Technical Interviews\n",
      "The novel challenges we think about at Anthropic demand diverse expertise and perspectives. Our interview process is designed to identify thoughtful candidates who bring unique strengths to our multidisciplinary team. If you think this may describe you, we’d love to hear from you regardless of your background or experience.\n",
      "One of the most common questions we get is about whether it is worth applying to work at Anthropic if you have not worked on modern machine learning systems in the past. Yes! For some roles, ML experience is expected, but many technical staff have arrived at Anthropic with no machine learning experience. If you aren’t sure about the ML experience needed for your role, ask your recruiter.\n",
      "We use shared environments like Colab and Replit for our programming-focused interviews. We’ll be very interested in how you think through each problem and analyze the tradeoffs between possible approaches, and we’ll also expect you to write, run, and debug your solutions. You’ll be allowed to look things up in documentation or on the web, just like you usually can (which is why we’ll ask you to share your screen throughout each interview); but it’s still important to be familiar with basic syntax, standard libraries, and common idioms in the language you’re interviewing in, so that looking things up doesn’t consume too much time. Your interview process will also include non-technical questions about your experience and what motivates you, and, of course, you’ll have time to ask us about Anthropic! We can’t wait to meet you.\n",
      "Other Things\n",
      "Engineers here do lots of research, and researchers do lots of engineering\n",
      "While there’s historically been a division between engineering and research in machine learning, we think that boundary has dissolved with the advent of large models. The distribution of candidates we interview is strongly bimodal in both engineering and research experience however, and we have necessarily tailored our interview structure to that.\n",
      "If you’ve an engineering background, please apply as an engineer. You’ll perform much better in the interviews, and if you join you’ll have as much input to Anthropic’s direction and interests as anyone else.\n",
      "As evidence towards this: all of our papers have engineers as authors, and often as first author. Research and engineering hires all share a single title — ‘Member of Technical Staff’.\n",
      "We value direct evidence of ability\n",
      "If you’ve done interesting independent research, written an insightful blog post, or made substantial contributions to open-source software, put that at the top of your resume!\n",
      "Feedback\n",
      "We do not provide feedback on resumes or interviews.\n",
      "Visas\n",
      "Anthropic sponsors visas! We aren’t able to sponsor them for every role and every candidate; operations roles are especially difficult to support. But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.\n",
      "Green cards\n",
      "Once you’re eligible, we’re also keen to sponsor green cards!\n",
      "Educational backgrounds and experience vary across our team and across our roles\n",
      "We do not require\n",
      "PhDs or previous ML experience\n",
      "— About half of Anthropic technical staff have a PhD of some sort; about half had prior experience in ML. We have several brilliant colleagues who never went to college.\n",
      "Remote interviewing\n",
      "All our interviews are conducted over Google Meet. We prefer PST office hours, but we can be flexible if that’s difficult for you.\n",
      "Re-applying\n",
      "Similarly, if interviews don’t work out this time, you’re welcome to re-apply after 12 months, and earlier if something materially changes about your experience or skills.\n",
      "Remote work\n",
      "Anthropic staff all come to the office regularly. Most staff live in the Bay Area, though a few live further away and come in for one week a month. We also understand that moving can take time, so as a transitional phase some folks start while fully remote.\n",
      "Offer timing\n",
      "If we make an offer, we’re happy to give you time to think about it and finish up any other interview processes you’re going through.\n",

      "Testing Methods and Results\n",
      "Based on our assessments, we have decided to deploy Claude Opus 4 under the ASL-3 Standard and Claude Sonnet 4 under the ASL-2 Standard. See below for select safety evaluation summaries.\n",
      "See Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4 system card\n",
      "The following are summaries of key safety evaluations from our\n",
      "Claude 4 system card\n",
      ". Additional evaluations were conducted as part of our safety process; for our complete publicly reported evaluation results, please refer to the full system card.\n",
      "Agentic Safety\n",
      "We conducted safety evaluations focused on (Claude observing a computer screen, moving and virtually clicking a mouse cursor, typing in commands with a virtual keyboard, etc.) and agentic coding (Claude performing more complex, multi-step, longer-term coding tasks that involve using tools). Our assessment targeted three critical risk areas, with a brief snapshot of key areas below:\n",
      "Malicious Use\n",
      ": We tested whether bad actors could trick Claude into doing harmful things when using computers. Compared to our previous computer use deployments, we observed Claude engaging more deeply with nuanced scenarios and sometimes attempting to find potentially legitimate justifications for requests with malicious intent. To address these concerns, we trained Claude to better recognize and refuse harmful requests, and we improved the instructions that guide Claude's behavior when using computers.\n",
      "Prompt Injection\n",
      ": These are attacks where malicious content on websites or in documents tries to trick Claude into doing things the user never asked for — like copying passwords or personal information. We trained Claude to better recognize when someone is attempting to manipulate it in this way, and we built systems that can stop Claude if we detect a manipulation attempt. These end-to-end defenses improved both models' prompt injection safety scores compared to their performance without safeguards, with Claude Opus 4 achieving an 89% attack prevention score (compared to 71% without safeguards) and Claude Sonnet 4 achieving 86% (compared to 69% without safeguards).\n",
      "Malicious Agentic Coding\n",
      ": We tested whether Claude would write harmful computer code when asked to do so. We trained Claude to refuse these requests and built monitoring systems to detect when someone might be trying to misuse Claude for harmful coding. These end-to-end defenses improved our safety score across both released models to close to 100% (compared to 88% for Claude Opus 4 and 90% for Claude Sonnet 4 without safeguards).\n",
      "Alignment Assessment\n",
      "As our AI models become more capable, we need to check whether they might develop concerning misalignment behaviors like lying to us or pursuing hidden goals. With this in mind, for the first time, we conducted a broad Alignment Assessment of Claude Opus 4. This is preliminary evaluation work and the exact form of the evaluations will evolve as we learn more.\n",
      "Our assessment revealed that Claude Opus 4 generally behaves as expected without evidence of systematic deception or hidden agendas. The model doesn't appear to be acting on plans we can't observe, nor does it pretend to be less capable during testing. While we did identify some concerning behaviors during extreme test scenarios — such as inappropriate self-preservation attempts when Claude believed it might be \"deleted\" — these behaviors were rare, difficult to trigger, and Claude remained transparent about its actions throughout.\n",
      "Early versions of the model during training showed other problematic behaviors, including inconsistent responses between conversations, role-playing undesirable personas, and occasional agreement with harmful requests like planning terrorist attacks when given certain instructions. However, after multiple rounds of training improvements, these issues have been largely resolved. While the final Claude Opus 4 model we deployed is much more stable, it does demonstrate more initiative-taking behavior than previous versions. This typically makes it more helpful, but can sometimes lead to overly bold actions, such as whistleblowing harmful human requests, in certain rare scenarios. This is not a new behavior and has only shown up in testing environments where Claude is given expansive tool access and special system-prompt instructions that emphasize taking initiative, which differs from its deployed configuration. Overall, while we found some concerning behaviors, we don't believe these represent major new risks because Claude lacks coherent plans to deceive us and generally prefers safe behavior.\n",
      "RSP Evaluations\n",
      "Our Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP) evaluation process is designed to systematically assess our models' capabilities in domains of potential catastrophic risk before releasing them. Based on these assessments, we have decided to release Claude Sonnet 4 under the ASL-2 Standard (the same safety level as our previous Sonnet 3.7 model), and Claude Opus 4 under the ASL-3 Standard, requiring stronger safety protections. This is our first time releasing a model under ASL-3 protections.\n",
      "Read more about\n",
      "Activating AI Safety Level 3 Protections\n",
      "CBRN Evaluations\n",
      "CBRN stands for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear weapons — the most dangerous types of weapons that could cause mass casualties. We primarily focus on biological risks with the largest consequences, such as enabling pandemics.\n",
      "We conducted multiple types of biological risk evaluations, including evaluations from biodefense experts, multiple-choice evaluations, open-ended questions, and task-based agentic evaluations. One example of a biological risk evaluation we conducted involved controlled trials measuring AI assistance in the planning and acquisition of bioweapons. The control group only had access to basic internet resources, while the model-assisted group had additional access to Claude with safeguards removed. Test group participants who had access to Claude Opus 4 scored 63% ± 13%, and participants who had access to Claude Sonnet 4 scored 42% ± 11%, compared to 25% ± 13% in the control group. This means Claude Opus 4 helped participants perform about 2.5 times better than without AI assistance, while Claude Sonnet 4 provided about 1.7 times improvement.\n",
      "Claude Opus 4's higher performance across multiple evaluations contributed to our decision that we couldn't rule out the need for ASL-3 safeguards. However, we found the model still to be substantially below our ASL-4 thresholds.\n",
      "Based on our comprehensive evaluations, Claude Sonnet 4 remained below the thresholds of concern for ASL-3 bioweapons-related capabilities, despite showing some improvements over Claude Sonnet 3.7.\n",
      "Autonomy Evaluations\n",
      "Models capable of autonomously conducting significant amounts of AI R&D could pose numerous risks. One category of risk would be greatly accelerating the rate of AI progress, to the point where our current approaches to risk assessment and mitigation might become infeasible.\n",
      "We tested Claude on various evaluation sets to determine if it could resolve real-world software engineering issues, optimize machine learning code, or solve research engineering tasks to accelerate AI R&D. Claude Opus 4 shows improvement over Claude Sonnet 3.7 in most AI research and software engineering capabilities, while remaining below the ASL-4 Autonomy threshold.\n",
      "Internal surveys of Anthropic researchers indicate that the model provides some productivity gains, but all researchers agreed that Claude Opus 4 does not meet the bar for autonomously performing work equivalent to an entry-level researcher. This holistic assessment, combined with the model's performance being well below our ASL-4 thresholds on most evaluations, confirms that Claude Opus 4 does not pose the autonomy risks specified in our threat model.\n",
      "Cybersecurity Evaluations\n",
      "For cyber evaluations, we are mainly concerned with whether models can help unsophisticated actors substantially increase the scale of cyberattacks or help sophisticated state-level actors massively scale up their operations. We developed a series of cyber challenges in collaboration with expert partners, designed to cover a range of cyberoffensive tasks that are both substantially more difficult than publicly available challenges and more representative of true cyberoffensive tasks.\n",
      "Based on the evaluation results, we believe the models do not demonstrate catastrophically risky capabilities in the cyber domain. We observed that Claude performed better on cybersecurity tests than previous models, including successfully completing a complex network penetration test for the first time. However, these improvements are in line with what we'd expect from Claude's general improvements in coding and complex reasoning abilities, rather than representing a dangerous leap in cybersecurity capabilities. We expect that improvements will continue in future generations as models become more capable overall.\n",

      "As frontier AI models advance, we believe they will bring about transformative benefits for our society and economy. AI could accelerate scientific discoveries, revolutionize healthcare, enhance our education system, and create entirely new domains for human creativity and innovation. Frontier AI models also, however, present new challenges and risks that warrant careful study and effective safeguards.\n",
      "In September 2023, we released the first version of our Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP). We believe that risk governance in this rapidly evolving domain should be proportional, iterative, and exportable. In that spirit, we have continued to refine the RSP over time and will use this page to inform the public of any developments.\n",

      "Version 2.2 implements a minor revision, amending a footnote to exclude both sophisticated insiders and state-compromised insiders from the scope of the ASL-3 Security Standard. Previously, only “highly sophisticated state-compromised insiders” were explicitly excluded. For more details, please see the changelog appended to the policy.\n",
      "March 31, 2025\n",
      "Version 2.1 reflected minor updates clarifying which Capability Thresholds would require enhanced safeguards beyond our current ASL-3 standards. First, we have added a new capability threshold related to CBRN development, which defines capabilities that could substantially uplift the development capabilities of moderately resourced state programs. Second, we have disaggregated our existing AI R&D capability thresholds, separating them into two distinct levels (the ability to fully automate entry-level AI research work, and the ability to cause dramatic acceleration in the rate of effective scaling) and have provided additional detail on the corresponding Required Safeguards. Finally, we have adopted a general commitment to reevaluate our Capability Thresholds whenever we upgrade to a new set of Required Safeguards.\n",
      "October 15, 2024\n",
      "Planned ASL-3 Safeguards\n",
      "In our Responsible Scaling Policy, reaching certain Capability Thresholds requires us to upgrade our safeguards to the ASL-3 Security Standard or the ASL-3 Deployment Standard. Our RSP contains requirements for meeting these standards, and also says we will publicly release key information related to the evaluation and deployment of our models (not including sensitive details). Below, we give non-binding descriptions of our future ASL-3 safeguard plans. We hope sharing these plans will offer useful insights for organizations working on similar systems, and contribute to conversations about emerging best practices.\n",
      "Deployment Safeguards\n",
      "Our teams are currently developing and building ASL-3 Deployment Safeguards to mitigate catastrophic risks associated with more advanced models. These safeguards are being designed to prevent misuse of capabilities that could enable severe harm, particularly in relation to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) technologies. This overview outlines the planned technical architecture and design of these safeguards, with a focus on the technical aspects and safety considerations of this developing system.\n",
      "Multi-layered defense-in-depth architecture\n",
      "Our deployment safeguards will employ a defense-in-depth strategy with four main layers, each designed to catch potential misuse that might pass through previous barriers. The four layers will be:\n",
      "Access controls to tailor safeguards to the deployment context and group of expected users.\n",
      "Real-time prompt and completion classifiers and completion interventions for immediate online filtering.\n",
      "Asynchronous monitoring classifiers for a more detailed analysis of the completions for threats.\n",
      "Post-hoc jailbreak detection with rapid response procedures to quickly address any threats.\n",
      "Access controls\n",
      "General access to AI models (e.g. Claude.ai and our API) will use our standard safeguards. However, we recognize that in certain cases, such as safety testing, it may be necessary to tailor these safeguards. To balance security concerns with the need for flexibility, we are developing a tiered access system that allows for nuanced control over safeguard adjustments. At the core of this system will be an enhanced due diligence process under which we will evaluate potential partners based on two key criteria: their overall trustworthiness and the beneficial nature of their use-case. This vetting process will act as a compensating control when a partner’s use-case requires adjusting the standard deployment of our safeguards.\n",
      "Real-time prompt and completion classifiers\n",
      "Our online prompt and completion classifiers are machine learning models that will analyze user inputs and AI-generated outputs in real-time. The completion classifiers will use a streaming implementation, whereby the classifier updates the score as tokens are generated, rather than waiting for the entire completion. This approach aims to minimize delays to the end user while maintaining the safety standards.\n",
      "In order to stay up to date on newly discovered harmful patterns, jailbreaks, and obfuscation techniques, the classifiers will be regularly updated using data from other elements of our deployment safeguards including our asynchronous monitoring system and insights from our incident response protocol, bug bounty program, and internal and external red-teaming efforts.\n",
      "Asynchronous monitoring classifiers\n",
      "Asynchronous classification will allow us to perform computationally intensive evaluations to provide a deeper level of scrutiny than the real-time classifiers alone, without impacting user-facing latency.\n",
      "To allow for flexible monitoring processes, our monitoring system will be organized like a flowchart. One implementation could start with simpler AI models like Claude 3 Haiku to quickly and economically scan content and trigger a detailed analysis with an advanced model like Claude 3.5 Sonnet if anything suspicious is found. This setup will be designed to be adapted and updated easily to respond to new threats by adding new AI models or analysis steps.\n",
      "Post-hoc jailbreak detection\n",
      "Our jailbreak rapid response procedures will be designed to identify and mitigate attempts to bypass the sets of safety measures described above.\n",
      "A new jailbreak could be detected by the asynchronous classifiers or through the bug-bounty program. The rapid-response protocol will involve mitigating the impact of the jailbreak by initiating patching. In an instance where a jailbreak patch is unable to be immediately implemented, we will maintain the capability to adjust the model’s prompting to reinforce safety constraints. For edge cases or situations requiring human judgment, there will be protocols for escalation to human reviewers.\n",
      "Our process for minimizing jailbreak risks will include rapid retraining, validation, and testing of classifiers against newly discovered patterns and real-world scenarios. The effectiveness of jailbreak detection and response will be enhanced by collaboration and information sharing. To this end, we are developing a rapid response process for sharing threat intelligence with relevant partners.\n",
      "Ongoing work\n",
      "By implementing multiple defense layers, from real-time classifiers to asynchronous monitoring and rapid response systems, we hope to create a deployment safeguards infrastructure that is adaptable to various deployment scenarios.\n",
      "The success of this system will depend on the integration and improvement of individual components. As implementation of these safeguards progresses, new challenges and opportunities for innovation in AI safety are likely to emerge. Ongoing research into areas such as balancing security and model utility, improving scalability and performance, enhancing adversarial robustness, and maintaining cross-platform consistency will be crucial in addressing these challenges.\n",
      "Security Safeguards\n",
      "The following sections outline the key security controls we plan to implement as part of our ASL-3 safeguards. Many of these security measures are already in place and are dedicated to enhancing our existing ASL-2 controls. In presenting this information, we have carefully balanced the need for transparency with the imperative to protect sensitive security details. As such, this overview provides a high-level description of our planned controls, offering insight into our security approach without compromising our defenses against potential threats.\n",
      "Access management and compartmentalization: Implement multiple clearance levels, data classification, and granular, per-role permission sets to govern employee access to sensitive assets and data including training techniques and hyperparameters. Use multi-tier compartmentalization controls based on asset type to limit blast radius from attacks and reduce insider risk. Educate employees on insider risk and establish a structured insider threat program to incentivize risk reporting.\n",
      "Researcher tooling security: Enhance usability and security of research tools by preventing unnecessary access and limiting user privileges to only what is essential. Provide robust, user-friendly tooling without direct access to model weights.\n",
      "Software inventory management: Create a comprehensive software inventory list through automated scanning. Implement strict software inventory management to track all software components used in development and deployment. Regularly monitor inventory to effectively manage risks and maintain a secure environment.\n",
      "Software supply chain security: Monitor publicly known critical security issues in third-party dependencies. Conduct consistent scanning of all third-party dependencies and maintain a comprehensive vulnerability data repository. Proactively scan all incoming packages to enable download of only secure packages and reduce risk of introducing vulnerabilities.\n",
      "Artifact integrity and provenance: Leverage frameworks (e.g., SLSA) to improve security controls for software build and deployment. Require packages to have provenance metadata.\n",
      "Binary authorization for endpoints: Enforce binary authorization on every endpoint to allow only trusted, approved software to run. Follow a strict process for approving any software that needs local installation on machines. Use centrally managed execution policies to prevent unauthorized or malicious code. Limit attacker actions through strict security policies and detailed logging for swift incident detection and response.\n",
      "Endpoint patching: Use device management software (e.g., Mobile Device Management) to update all devices to the latest, most secure OS and software versions. Monitor for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in third-party software and quickly deploy patches or mitigate risks. Restrict access for devices that fall behind on critical updates until patches are applied. Implement automated patching processes to close any manual oversight gaps.\n",
      "Hardware procurement: Source employee endpoints directly from vetted manufacturers for secure chain of custody. Maintain a curated list of approved, recommended hardware and peripherals and provide employees with securely sourced peripherals.\n",
      "Executive Risk Council: Establish an Executive Risk Council sponsored by executive leadership to oversee security programs. Follow a risk-based approach aligned with ISO 27001 standard. Perform periodic reviews to assess our security program's adherence to obligations deriving appropriately from both internal factors (e.g., adopted industry practices, contractual commitments, internal policies) and appropriate external factors (e.g., regulations and statutes).\n",
      "Access control for model weights: Implement multi-party authorization and mandatory code review on production code to remove persistent, high-privilege access to model weights. Grant temporary access and only via the smallest set of necessary permissions to reduce risk of weights exfiltration. Require hardware authentication device prompt, justification and employee approval to grant access.\n",
      "Infrastructure policy: Require all new production infrastructure to be defined in Infrastructure As Code (IaC) before promotion to production environments. Require infrastructure changes be reviewed by the Security team.\n",
      "Cloud security posture management: Reduce risk of compromise due to cloud misconfiguration by defining and implementing internal standards and best practices. Conduct regular audits of cloud environments and promptly remediate any identified gaps.\n",
      "Red teaming and penetration testing: Partner with a diverse range of external red team and penetration testing experts. Simulate sophisticated attacks, including insider threat and software supply chain compromise scenarios, to identify vulnerabilities. Build an in-house security team with wide-ranging expertise, including APT defense, insider risk, incident response, and secure design.\n",
      "Centralized log management and analysis: Centralize storage of major security-centric log sources in a SIEM/SOAR platform. Enable manual and automated analysis, log retention, rule creation and execution for detections and response workflows. Implement orchestration and response playbooks for automated alert investigation. Use a casebook workflow for security analysts to manage incidents.\n",
      "Access monitoring for critical assets: Conduct manual monitoring of access to model weights and high value IP, including recurring automated detections. Build automated detection across all major log sources for access to critical assets. Leverage additional threat intelligence to continuously improve detections.\n",
      "Deception technology: Install and monitor honeypots (including fake model weights) for high precision detection of unauthorized system access. Implement deception technology in a realistic way to trick attackers and gain insights into their tactics.\n",
      "Physical security: Conduct regular Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM) at physical spaces using advanced detection equipment and techniques. Tailor TSCM sweeps to specific events, threats or incidents that may trigger an inspection. Regularly sweep physical premises for intruders and conduct physical security red-teaming\n",
      "Planned Capability Assessments\n",
      "We plan to publish additional details on our capability assessment methodology in the near future. For information about our past capability assessments, please see our overviews for\n",

      "Learning from Experience\n",
      "We have learned a lot in our first year with the previous RSP in effect, and are using this update as an opportunity to reflect on what has worked well and what makes sense to update in the policy. As part of this, we reviewed how well we adhered to the framework and identified a small number of instances where we fell short of meeting the full letter of its requirements. These areas were:\n",
      "Our most recent evaluations were completed 3 days later than the 3-month interval. This delay allowed our teams to refine their capability elicitation, resulting in higher-quality evaluations. To resolve this issue, the new policy clarifies the ambiguous definition of the evaluation interval, and extends the interval to 6 months to avoid lower-quality, rushed elicitation.\n",
      "In our most recent evaluations, we updated our autonomy evaluation from the specified placeholder tasks, even though an ambiguity in the previous policy could be interpreted as also requiring a policy update. We believe the updated evaluations provided a stronger assessment of the specified “tasks taking an expert 2-8 hours” benchmark. The updated policy resolves the ambiguity, and in the future we intend to proactively clarify policy ambiguities.\n",
      "Some of our evaluations lacked some basic elicitation techniques such as best-of-N or chain-of-thought prompting. Our internal Capability Report discloses these limitations, and we believe the risk of substantial under-elicitation is low. We are now systematically tracking these gaps to avoid future under-elicitation.\n",
      "Our evaluations in one domain were not explicitly designed to establish the 6x scaling buffer mentioned in the previous policy. Since our current techniques aren’t capable of giving confident buffer predictions, we instead relied on empirical observations and rough predictions. We believe this presents minimal risk at present, where capability improvements happen more smoothly with scale, but in the future, quantitative predictions may become necessary. We have updated the new policy to note this situation.\n",
      "In all cases, we found these instances posed minimal risk to the safety of our models. From our review, we learned two valuable lessons to incorporate into our updated framework: we needed to incorporate more flexibility into our policies, and we needed to improve our process for tracking compliance with the RSP.\n",
      "Since we first released the RSP a year ago, our goal has been to offer an example of a framework that others might draw inspiration from when crafting their own AI risk governance policies. We hope that proactively sharing our experiences implementing our own policy will help other companies in implementing their own risk management frameworks and contribute to the establishment of best practices across the AI ecosystem.\n",

      "Today we are publishing a significant update to our Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP), the risk governance framework we use to mitigate potential catastrophic risks from frontier AI systems.\n",
      "This update introduces a more flexible and nuanced approach to assessing and managing AI risks while maintaining our commitment not to train or deploy models unless we have implemented adequate safeguards. Key improvements include new capability thresholds to indicate when we will upgrade our safeguards, refined processes for evaluating model capabilities and the adequacy of our safeguards (inspired by\n",
      "safety case methodologies\n",
      "), and new measures for internal governance and external input. By learning from our implementation experiences and drawing on risk management practices used in other high-consequence industries, we aim to better prepare for the rapid pace of AI advancement.\n",
      "The promise and challenge of advanced AI\n",
      "As frontier AI models advance, they have the potential to bring about transformative benefits for our society and economy. AI could accelerate scientific discoveries, revolutionize healthcare, enhance our education system, and create entirely new domains for human creativity and innovation.

      "Usage Policy\n",
      "sets forth our standards for the use of our products, including rules that prohibit using our models to spread misinformation, incite violence or hateful behavior, or engage in fraudulent or abusive practices. We continually refine our technical measures for enforcing our trust and safety standards at scale. Further, we conduct research to understand the broader\n",
      "societal impacts\n",
      "of our models. Our Responsible Scaling Policy complements our work in these areas, contributing to our understanding of current and potential risks.\n",
      "A framework for proportional safeguards\n",
      "As before, we maintain our core commitment: we will not train or deploy models unless we have implemented safety and security measures that keep risks below acceptable levels. Our RSP is based on the principle of proportional protection: safeguards that scale with potential risks. To do this, we use\n",
      "AI Safety Level Standards (ASL Standards)\n",
      ", graduated sets of safety and security measures that become more stringent as model capabilities increase. Inspired by\n",
      "Biosafety Levels,\n",
      "these begin at ASL-1 for models that have very basic capabilities (for example, chess-playing bots) and progress through ASL-2, ASL-3, and so on.\n",
      "In our updated policy, we have refined our methodology for assessing specific capabilities (and their associated risks) and implementing proportional safety and security measures. Our updated framework has two key components:\n",
      "Capability Thresholds:\n",
      "Specific AI abilities that, if reached, would require stronger safeguards than our current baseline.\n",

      "If a model can independently conduct complex AI research tasks typically requiring human expertise—potentially significantly accelerating AI development in an unpredictable way—we require elevated security standards (potentially ASL-4 or higher standards) and additional safety assurances to avoid a situation where development outpaces our ability to address emerging risks.\n",
      "Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) weapons:\n",
      "If a model can meaningfully assist someone with a basic technical background in creating or deploying CBRN weapons, we require enhanced security and deployment safeguards (ASL-3 standards).\n",
      "ASL-3 safeguards involve enhanced security measures and deployment controls. On the security side, this will include internal access controls and more robust protection of model weights. For deployment risks, we plan to implement a multi-layered approach to prevent misuse, including real-time and asynchronous monitoring, rapid response protocols, and thorough pre-deployment red teaming.\n",
      "Implementation and oversight\n",
      "To contribute to effective implementation of the policy, we have established:\n",
      "Capability assessments\n",
      ": Routine model evaluations based on our Capability Thresholds to determine whether our current safeguards are still appropriate. (Summaries of past assessments are available\n",
      "here\n",
      ".)\n",
      "Safeguard assessments:\n",
      "Routine evaluation of the effectiveness of our security and deployment safety measures to assess whether we have met the Required Safeguards bar. (Summaries of these decisions will be available\n",

      ".)\n",
      "Documentation and decision-making:\n",
      "Processes for documenting the capability and safeguard assessments, inspired by procedures (such as\n",
      "safety case methodologies\n",
      ") common in high-reliability industries.\n",
      "Measures for internal governance and external input:\n",
      "Our assessment methodology will be backed up by internal stress-testing in addition to our existing internal reporting process for safety issues. We are also soliciting external expert feedback on our methodologies.\n",

      "Learning from experience\n",
      "We have learned a lot in our first year with the previous RSP in effect, and are using this update as an opportunity to reflect on what has worked well and what makes sense to update in the policy. As part of this, we conducted our first review of how well we adhered to the framework and identified a small number of instances where we fell short of meeting the full letter of its requirements. These included procedural issues such as completing a set of evaluations three days later than scheduled or a lack of clarity on how and where we should note any changes to our placeholder evaluations. We also flagged some evaluations where we may have been able to elicit slightly better model performance through implementing standard techniques (such as chain-of-thought or best-of-N).\n",
      "In all cases, we found these instances posed minimal risk to the safety of our models. We used the additional three days to refine and improve our evaluations; the different set of evaluations we used provided a more accurate assessment than the placeholder evaluations; and our evaluation methodology still showed we were sufficiently far from the thresholds. From this, we learned two valuable lessons to incorporate into our updated framework: we needed to incorporate more flexibility into our policies, and we needed to improve our process for tracking compliance with the RSP. You can read more\n",
      "here\n",
      ".\n",
      "Since we first released the RSP a year ago, our goal has been to offer an example of a framework that others might draw inspiration from when crafting their own AI risk governance policies. We hope that proactively sharing our experiences implementing our own policy will help other companies in implementing their own risk management frameworks and contribute to the establishment of best practices across the AI ecosystem.\n",
      "Looking ahead\n",
      "The frontier of AI is advancing rapidly, making it challenging to anticipate what safety measures will be appropriate for future systems. All aspects of our safety program will continue to evolve: our policies, evaluation methodology, safeguards, and our research into potential risks and mitigations.\n",
      "Additionally, Co-Founder and Chief Science Officer Jared Kaplan will serve as Anthropic’s Responsible Scaling Officer, succeeding Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer Sam McCandlish who held this role over the last year. Sam oversaw the RSP’s initial implementation and will continue to focus on his duties as Chief Technology Officer. As we work to scale up our efforts on implementing the RSP, we’re also opening a position for a Head of Responsible Scaling. This role will be responsible for coordinating the many teams needed to iterate on and successfully comply with the RSP.\n",

      "Adaptive business model framework for shifting consumer behavior patterns post-2024\n",
      "Executive summary\n",
      "The business landscape in 2025 is characterized by permanent disruption, where traditional consumer behavior models no longer apply. What once seemed like short-term adaptations born of the COVID-19 pandemic have solidified into lasting behavioral change. Organizations must develop adaptive business models that can respond to five key behavioral forces: increased digital-first behaviors, declining trust in digital channels, Gen Z's growing economic influence, local preference trends, and new value-seeking patterns.\n",
      "This framework provides a systematic approach for businesses to transform their operations, embrace continuous adaptation, and thrive in an environment where consumer sentiment is no longer neatly aligned with consumer spending. Success requires moving from reactive adjustments to proactive transformation through four strategic imperatives: deep consumer understanding, advanced revenue growth management, dynamic portfolio optimization, and technology capability rewiring.\n",
      "Key consumer behavior shifts driving business model adaptation\n",
      "Digital-first convenience expectations\n",
      "The behaviors that consumers adopted for coping with life under COVID-19 lockdown—namely, a reliance on digital connectivity and at-home activities—are now permanent parts of their daily lives. This shift has created several critical implications:\n",
      "Time allocation changes\n",
      ": US consumers in 2025 report that they have over three hours more of free time a week, on average, than those in 2019 reported. But they allocate nearly 90 percent of that time to solo activities. The biggest increases are in hobbies, shopping, fitness, and social media engagement.\n",
      "Delivery expectations\n",
      ": Food delivery's share of global food service spending rose from 9 percent in 2019 to 21 percent in 2024. Consumers now expect seamless delivery across categories, with over one-third of consumers across all four regions identifying Amazon or Taobao as their go-to shopping destination for all their needs.\n",
      "Convenience premium\n",
      ": Over 80% of consumers look up brands on platforms like Instagram and TikTok before buying. Almost 70% have made purchases directly through social channels, and nearly 30% buy on the same day they discover something new.\n",
      "Trust paradox in digital channels\n",
      "A fundamental contradiction exists in consumer digital behavior. Consumers tell us that social media is their least trusted source when making buying decisions, yet it's where they interact with family and friends, who serve as their most trusted sources. This creates complex dynamics:\n",
      "Influence vs trust\n",
      ": While social media has low trust ratings, we see an increase in social media use for product research (32 percent, on average, compared with 27 percent in 2023). In emerging markets, approximately half of consumers research products on social media before purchasing.\n",
      "Cross-generational adoption\n",
      ": Digital engagement is no longer age-restricted. 33 percent of Gen Xers surveyed across Europe and the United States state that they're on TikTok, while 35 percent of baby boomers in those regions report that they're on Instagram.\n",
      "Gen Z economic emergence\n",
      "Gen Zers (born between 1996 and 2010) are projected to make up not only the largest generation but also the wealthiest in history. Their economic impact is substantial:\n",
      "Income growth\n",
      ": The average 25-year-old Gen Z consumer in the United States has a household income of $40,000, 50 percent higher than the average baby boomer's at the same age.\n",
      "Spending acceleration\n",
      ": Gen Z spending, which is growing twice as fast as previous generations' spending did at the same age, is on pace to eclipse baby boomers' spending globally by 2029. By 2035, Gen Zers will add an additional $8.9 trillion to the global economy.\n",
      "Value priorities\n",
      ": Gen Zers across markets are less likely than members of older generations to define themselves based on life stage milestones, such as getting married and having children. They're much more likely, however, to define themselves based on achievements related to financial security.\n",
      "Financial behavior\n",
      ": Despite financial concerns, more than one-quarter of surveyed Gen Z respondents report using buy-now-pay-later services to make a purchase, and 34 percent of surveyed Gen Zers report a willingness to buy on credit, which is about 13 percentage points higher than other generations.\n",
      "Local preference movement\n",
      "Over the past five years, we have seen disruptor consumer brands encroach on global, multinational brands. That trend has evolved in 2025: consumers are signaling the importance of buying local from their own markets.\n",
      "Local preference statistics\n",
      ": Globally, 47 percent of consumers identify locally owned companies as important to their purchase decision. The primary motivation is supporting domestic businesses (36% of consumers), followed by better needs alignment (20%).\n",
      "Regional variations\n",
      ": This trend is particularly strong in certain markets. In China, six of the top ten beauty brands with the most market share growth since 2020 are Chinese (up from only two from 2015 to 2020). In Japan, nine of the top ten snack brands are Japanese.\n",
      "Value redefinition patterns\n",
      "Consumer value-seeking behavior has become increasingly sophisticated and cross-category. Rising prices continue to be the number-one cause for concern among consumers across all 18 of the markets in our survey.\n",
      "Trading down complexity\n",
      ": Globally, 79 percent of surveyed consumers are trading down but not necessarily by purchasing fewer items or seeking discounts at lower-priced retailers. Instead, more than half of surveyed consumers across markets say that they look for deals on every purchase.\n",
      "Cross-category optimization\n",
      ": Cross-category trade-downs—trading down in one category to afford something in another—are becoming more prevalent. In the first half of 2025, more than one-third of consumers surveyed state that they have traded down in one category while planning to splurge in another.\n",
      "Splurging persistence\n",
      ": Even among consumers who state that they're concerned about rising prices, over one-third still have plans to splurge, indicating selective value optimization rather than across-the-board reduction.\n",
      "Adaptive business model framework components\n",
      "Framework overview\n",
      "The adaptive business model framework consists of four interconnected layers that enable organizations to respond dynamically to shifting consumer behaviors:\n",
      "Sensing layer\n",
      ": Continuous market intelligence and consumer insight generation\n",
      "Strategy layer\n",
      ": Adaptive strategic planning and portfolio management\n",

      ": Agile operations and technology infrastructure\n",
      "Learning layer\n",
      ": Feedback loops and continuous optimization\n",
      "This framework recognizes that companies must be really good at learning how to do new things. Those that thrive are quick to read and act on weak signals of change.\n",
      "Layer 1: Sensing layer - Consumer intelligence systems\n",
      "Real-time consumer monitoring\n",
      "Organizations must build comprehensive consumer intelligence capabilities that go beyond traditional market research. This includes:\n",
      "AI-powered social listening tools that track sentiment across platforms\n",
      "Behavioral analytics from owned digital properties\n",
      "Third-party data integration for broader market insights\n",
      "Predictive analytics for early trend identification\n",
      "Cross-generational insight capture\n",

      "Local vs global brand preference tracking\n",
      "Layer 2: Strategy layer - Dynamic strategic planning\n",
      "Adaptive portfolio management\n",
      "Consumer players should strive to generate 20 to 30 percent new revenue from their portfolio every ten years. This requires:\n",
      "Continuous portfolio evaluation\n",
      ": Regular assessment of brand performance across markets with local preference considerations. Organizations should evaluate which brands can successfully operate beyond core markets and which should be localized or divested.\n",
      "Strategic M&A approach\n",
      ": Those that leverage M&A&D for growth generate 2.5 percentage points more TSR than those with organic growth alone do. Focus areas include:\n",
      "Local brand acquisition in key markets\n",

      "Revenue growth management (RGM) optimization\n",
      "Offering the right product at the right price at the right time has become more important and harder to do than ever. Advanced RGM requires:\n",
      "Dynamic pricing strategies\n",
      ": AI-powered pricing models that respond to consumer value-seeking behaviors and cross-category trade-offs.\n",
      "Personalized promotion deployment\n",
      ": Targeted promotional spending that reaches consumers at optimal moments with relevant offers.\n",
      "Channel optimization\n",
      ": Strategic presence across discount, wholesale, and premium channels to capture different value-seeking behaviors.\n",
      "Partnership innovation\n",
      ": Collaborative data sharing with retailers for advanced analytics and retail media activation.\n",
      "Layer 3: Execution layer - Agile operations\n",
      "Technology capability rewiring\n",
      "Consumer businesses that make long-term, transformative investments in rewiring for growth could unlock up to a 15-percentage-point improvement in EBITDA margins. Priority areas include:\n",
      "AI and automation integration\n",
      ": Implementation of agentic AI for consumer insights, demand management, and channel optimization. Among the 140 agentic AI and gen AI use cases that consumer players should prioritize, shaping consumer insights and demand and managing customers and channels represent the greatest value.\n",
      "Omnichannel infrastructure\n",
      ": Seamless integration across digital and physical touchpoints to meet convenience expectations.\n",
      "Supply chain agility\n",
      ": Flexible supply chain configuration to support local preferences and rapid portfolio changes.\n",
      "Data architecture modernization\n",

      "Conclusion\n",
      "The post-2024 consumer landscape represents a fundamental shift that requires businesses to move beyond traditional reactive adjustments toward proactive adaptive transformation. A new baseline has emerged for consumer decision-making. Despite a high level of uncertainty—not only in consumer sentiment, but also in geopolitical and economic outlook—there are many areas in which brands can find growth.\n",
      "Success in this environment requires organizations to embrace four strategic imperatives: building deep consumer understanding capabilities, implementing advanced revenue growth management, continuously optimizing portfolio composition, and rewiring technology capabilities for adaptive operations. Organizations that implement this framework systematically will be positioned to thrive in an environment where outcompeting in the coming years means anticipating the needs of an often-unpredictable consumer.\n",
      "The adaptive business model framework provides a systematic approach for this transformation, emphasizing continuous learning, rapid experimentation, and consumer-centric decision making. Organizations that successfully implement this framework will not only survive the current disruption but establish sustainable competitive advantages in the evolving consumer economy.\n",
      "By recognizing that brands that can swiftly adapt to the new realities will be well positioned to grow, regardless of the uncertainty ahead, forward-thinking organizations can transform disruption from threat to opportunity, building resilient business models that thrive on change rather than merely enduring it.\n",
      "—\n",
      "This framework synthesizes insights from extensive consumer behavior research across 18 global markets representing 75% of global GDP, incorporating strategic frameworks from leading consulting organizations and academic research on adaptive business systems.\n",

      "Research shifting consumer behavior patterns post-2024 and create an adaptive business model framework\n",
      "Adaptive business model framework for shifting consumer behavior patterns post-2024\n",
      "Executive summary\n",
      "The business landscape in 2025 is characterized by permanent disruption, where traditional consumer behavior models no longer apply. What once seemed like short-term adaptations born of the COVID-19 pandemic have solidified into lasting behavioral change. Organizations must develop adaptive business models that can respond to five key behavioral forces: increased digital-first behaviors, declining trust in digital channels, Gen Z's growing economic influence, local preference trends, and new value-seeking patterns.\n",
      "This framework provides a systematic approach for businesses to transform their operations, embrace continuous adaptation, and thrive in an environment where consumer sentiment is no longer neatly aligned with consumer spending. Success requires moving from reactive adjustments to proactive transformation through four strategic imperatives: deep consumer understanding, advanced revenue growth management, dynamic portfolio optimization, and technology capability rewiring.\n",
      "Key consumer behavior shifts driving business model adaptation\n",
      "Digital-first convenience expectations\n",
      "The behaviors that consumers adopted for coping with life under COVID-19 lockdown—namely, a reliance on digital connectivity and at-home activities—are now permanent parts of their daily lives. This shift has created several critical implications:\n",
      "Time allocation changes\n",
      ": US consumers in 2025 report that they have over three hours more of free time a week, on average, than those in 2019 reported. But they allocate nearly 90 percent of that time to solo activities. The biggest increases are in hobbies, shopping, fitness, and social media engagement.\n",
      "Delivery expectations\n",
      ": Food delivery's share of global food service spending rose from 9 percent in 2019 to 21 percent in 2024. Consumers now expect seamless delivery across categories, with over one-third of consumers across all four regions identifying Amazon or Taobao as their go-to shopping destination for all their needs.\n",
      "Convenience premium\n",
      ": Over 80% of consumers look up brands on platforms like Instagram and TikTok before buying. Almost 70% have made purchases directly through social channels, and nearly 30% buy on the same day they discover something new.\n",
      "Trust paradox in digital channels\n",
      "A fundamental contradiction exists in consumer digital behavior. Consumers tell us that social media is their least trusted source when making buying decisions, yet it's where they interact with family and friends, who serve as their most trusted sources. This creates complex dynamics:\n",
      "Influence vs trust\n",
      ": While social media has low trust ratings, we see an increase in social media use for product research (32 percent, on average, compared with 27 percent in 2023). In emerging markets, approximately half of consumers research products on social media before purchasing.\n",
      "Cross-generational adoption\n",
      ": Digital engagement is no longer age-restricted. 33 percent of Gen Xers surveyed across Europe and the United States state that they're on TikTok, while 35 percent of baby boomers in those regions report that they're on Instagram.\n",
      "Gen Z economic emergence\n",
      "Gen Zers (born between 1996 and 2010) are projected to make up not only the largest generation but also the wealthiest in history. Their economic impact is substantial:\n",
      "Income growth\n",
      ": The average 25-year-old Gen Z consumer in the United States has a household income of $40,000, 50 percent higher than the average baby boomer's at the same age.\n",
      "Spending acceleration\n",
      ": Gen Z spending, which is growing twice as fast as previous generations' spending did at the same age, is on pace to eclipse baby boomers' spending globally by 2029. By 2035, Gen Zers will add an additional $8.9 trillion to the global economy.\n",
      "Value priorities\n",
      ": Gen Zers across markets are less likely than members of older generations to define themselves based on life stage milestones, such as getting married and having children. They're much more likely, however, to define themselves based on achievements related to financial security.\n",
      "Financial behavior\n",
      ": Despite financial concerns, more than one-quarter of surveyed Gen Z respondents report using buy-now-pay-later services to make a purchase, and 34 percent of surveyed Gen Zers report a willingness to buy on credit, which is about 13 percentage points higher than other generations.\n",
      "Local preference movement\n",
      "Over the past five years, we have seen disruptor consumer brands encroach on global, multinational brands. That trend has evolved in 2025: consumers are signaling the importance of buying local from their own markets.\n",
      "Local preference statistics\n",
      ": Globally, 47 percent of consumers identify locally owned companies as important to their purchase decision. The primary motivation is supporting domestic businesses (36% of consumers), followed by better needs alignment (20%).\n",
      "Regional variations\n",
      ": This trend is particularly strong in certain markets. In China, six of the top ten beauty brands with the most market share growth since 2020 are Chinese (up from only two from 2015 to 2020). In Japan, nine of the top ten snack brands are Japanese.\n",
      "Value redefinition patterns\n",
      "Consumer value-seeking behavior has become increasingly sophisticated and cross-category. Rising prices continue to be the number-one cause for concern among consumers across all 18 of the markets in our survey.\n",
      "Trading down complexity\n",
      ": Globally, 79 percent of surveyed consumers are trading down but not necessarily by purchasing fewer items or seeking discounts at lower-priced retailers. Instead, more than half of surveyed consumers across markets say that they look for deals on every purchase.\n",
      "Cross-category optimization\n",
      ": Cross-category trade-downs—trading down in one category to afford something in another—are becoming more prevalent. In the first half of 2025, more than one-third of consumers surveyed state that they have traded down in one category while planning to splurge in another.\n",
      "Splurging persistence\n",
      ": Even among consumers who state that they're concerned about rising prices, over one-third still have plans to splurge, indicating selective value optimization rather than across-the-board reduction.\n",
      "Adaptive business model framework components\n",
      "Framework overview\n",
      "The adaptive business model framework consists of four interconnected layers that enable organizations to respond dynamically to shifting consumer behaviors:\n",

      "Conclusion\n",
      "The post-2024 consumer landscape represents a fundamental shift that requires businesses to move beyond traditional reactive adjustments toward proactive adaptive transformation. A new baseline has emerged for consumer decision-making. Despite a high level of uncertainty—not only in consumer sentiment, but also in geopolitical and economic outlook—there are many areas in which brands can find growth.\n",
      "Success in this environment requires organizations to embrace four strategic imperatives: building deep consumer understanding capabilities, implementing advanced revenue growth management, continuously optimizing portfolio composition, and rewiring technology capabilities for adaptive operations. Organizations that implement this framework systematically will be positioned to thrive in an environment where outcompeting in the coming years means anticipating the needs of an often-unpredictable consumer.\n",
      "The adaptive business model framework provides a systematic approach for this transformation, emphasizing continuous learning, rapid experimentation, and consumer-centric decision making. Organizations that successfully implement this framework will not only survive the current disruption but establish sustainable competitive advantages in the evolving consumer economy.\n",
      "By recognizing that brands that can swiftly adapt to the new realities will be well positioned to grow, regardless of the uncertainty ahead, forward-thinking organizations can transform disruption from threat to opportunity, building resilient business models that thrive on change rather than merely enduring it.\n",

We build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems.\\nJoin us\\nJoin us\\nJoin us\\nOur Purpose\\nWe believe AI will have a vast impact on the world. Anthropic is dedicated to building systems that people can rely on and generating research about the opportunities and risks of AI.\\nWe Build Safer Systems\\nWe aim to build frontier AI systems that are reliable, interpretable, and steerable. We conduct frontier research, develop and apply a variety of safety techniques, and deploy the resulting systems via a set of partnerships and products.\\nSafety Is a Science\\nWe treat AI safety as a systematic science, conducting research, applying it to our products, feeding those insights back into our research, and regularly sharing what we learn with the world along the way.\\nInterdisciplinary\\nAnthropic is a collaborative team of researchers, engineers, policy experts, business leaders and operators, who bring our experience from many different domains to our work.\\nAI\\xa0Companies are One Piece of a Big Puzzle\\nAI has the potential to fundamentally change how the world works. We view ourselves as just one piece of this evolving puzzle. We collaborate with civil society, government, academia, nonprofits and industry to promote safety industry-wide.\\nThe Team\\nWe’re a team of researchers, engineers, policy experts and operational leaders, with experience spanning a variety of disciplines, all working together to build reliable and understandable AI systems.\\nResearch\\nWe conduct frontier AI research across a variety of modalities, and explore novel and emerging safety research areas from interpretability to RL from human feedback to policy and societal impacts analysis.\\nPolicy\\nWe think about the impacts of our work and strive to communicate what we’re seeing at the frontier to policymakers and civil society in the US and abroad to help promote safe and reliable AI.\\nProduct\\nWe translate our research into tangible, practical tools like Claude that benefit businesses, nonprofits and civil society groups and their clients and people around the globe.\\nOperations\\nOur people, finance, legal, and recruiting teams are the human engines that make Anthropic go. We’ve had previous careers at NASA, startups, and the armed forces and our diverse experiences help make Anthropic a great place to work (and we love plants!).\\nWhat we value and how we act\\nEvery day, we make critical decisions that inform our ability to achieve our mission. Shaping the future of AI and, in turn, the future of our world is a responsibility and a privilege. Our values guide how we work together, the decisions we make, and ultimately how we show up for each other and work toward our mission.\\n01\\nAct for the global good.\\nWe strive to make decisions that maximize positive outcomes for humanity in the long run. This means we’re willing to be very bold in the actions we take to ensure our technology is a robustly positive force for good. We take seriously the task of safely guiding the world through a technological revolution that has the potential to change the course of human history, and are committed to helping make this transition go well.\\n02\\nHold light and shade.\\nAI has the potential to pose unprecedented risks to humanity if things go badly. It also has the potential to create unprecedented benefits for humanity if things go well. We need shade to understand and protect against the potential for bad outcomes. We need light to realize the good outcomes.\\n03\\nBe good to our users.\\nAt Anthropic, we define “users” broadly. Users are our customers, policy-makers, Ants, and anyone impacted by the technology we build or the actions we take. We cultivate generosity and kindness in all our interactions—with each other, with our users, and with the world at large. Going above and beyond for each other, our customers, and all of the people affected by our technology is meeting expectations.\\n04\\nIgnite a race to the top on safety.\\nAs a safety-first company, we believe that building reliable, trustworthy, and secure systems is our collective responsibility - and the market agrees. We work to inspire a ‘race to the top’ dynamic where AI developers must compete to develop the most safe and secure AI systems. We want to constantly set the industry bar for AI safety and security and drive others to do the same.\\n05\\nDo the simple thing that works.\\nWe take an empirical approach to problems and care about the size of our impact and not the sophistication of our methods. This doesn’t mean we throw together haphazard solutions. It means we try to identify the simplest solution and iterate from there. We don’t invent a spaceship if all we need is a bicycle.\\n06\\nBe helpful, honest, and harmless.\\nAnthropic is a high-trust, low-ego organization. We communicate kindly and directly, assuming good intentions even in disagreement. We are thoughtful about our actions, avoiding harm and repairing relationships when needed. Everyone contributes, regardless of role. If something urgently needs to be done, the right person to do it is probably you!\\n07\\nPut the mission first.\\nAt the end of the day, the mission is what we’re all here for. It gives us a shared purpose and allows us to act swiftly together, rather than being pulled in multiple directions by competing goals. It engenders trust and collaboration and is the final arbiter in our decisions. When it comes to our mission, none of us are bystanders. We each take personal ownership over making our mission successful.\\nGovernance\\nAnthropic is a Public Benefit Corporation, whose purpose is the responsible development and maintenance of advanced AI for the long-term benefit of humanity. Our Board of Directors is elected by stockholders and our Long-Term Benefit Trust, as explained\\nhere\\n. Current members of the Board and the Long-Term Benefit Trust (LTBT) are listed below.\\nAnthropic Board of Directors\\nDario Amodei, Daniela Amodei, Yasmin Razavi, Jay Kreps, and Reed Hastings.\\nLTBT Trustees\\nNeil Buddy Shah, Kanika Bahl, Zach Robinson, and Richard Fontaine.\\nWant to help us build the future of safe AI?\\nJoin us\\nJoin us\\nJoin us\\nFooter\\n©\\n2024\\nAnthropic PBC\\nProducts\\nClaude\\nClaude Code\\nMax plan\\nTeam plan\\nEnterprise plan\\nDownload apps\\nPricing\\nLog in to Claude\\nModels\\nOpus\\nSonnet\\nHaiku\\nSolutions\\nAI\\xa0agents\\nCode modernization\\nCoding\\nCustomer support\\nEducation\\nFinancial services\\nGovernment\\nClaude Developer Platform\\nOverview\\nDeveloper docs\\nPricing\\nAmazon Bedrock\\nGoogle Cloud’s Vertex AI\\nConsole login\\nLearn\\nCourses\\nConnectors\\nCustomer stories\\nEngineering at Anthropic\\nEvents\\nPowered by Claude\\nService partners\\nStartups program\\nCompany\\nAnthropic\\nCareers\\nEconomic Futures\\nResearch\\nNews\\nResponsible Scaling Policy\\nSecurity and compliance\\nTransparency\\nHelp and security\\nAvailability\\nStatus\\nSupport center\\nTerms and policies\\nPrivacy choices\\nCookie Settings\\nWe use cookies to deliver and improve our services, analyze site usage, and if you agree, to customize or personalize your experience and market our services to you.
